# Skill Manager

A Claude Code skill that allows you to search, browse, and install skills from a database of 31,767+ community skills with intelligent folder-level downloads.

## Description

Skill Manager provides an easy way to discover and install Claude Code skills. Simply describe what you're looking for, and it will search through a comprehensive database of skills, display matching results with ratings and descriptions, and automatically download the complete skill folder (not just SKILL.md) to your Claude environment.

## Features

- Search through 31,767+ skills from the community
- Intelligent search with weighted scoring (name, description, author)
- View skill details including stars, forks, author, and description
- **Smart installation with multiple methods:**
  - **SVN export** (preferred): Downloads only the skill folder efficiently
  - **Git sparse checkout**: Falls back if SVN unavailable
  - **SKILL.md only**: Final fallback for minimal installation
- Complete folder download including all scripts, data, and documentation
- Automatic configuration and usage guide display
- Support for both English and Chinese descriptions

## Installation Methods

The skill automatically selects the best available method:

### 1. SVN Export (Recommended)
- **Fastest and most efficient**
- Downloads only the specific skill folder
- No Git history overhead
- **Requirement**: SVN client installed
  - Windows: `choco install svn` or download from TortoiseSVN
  - Mac: `brew install svn`
  - Linux: `apt-get install subversion` or `yum install subversion`

### 2. Git Sparse Checkout
- Alternative when SVN unavailable
- Uses Git's sparse checkout feature
- Downloads only needed files
- **Requirement**: Git installed

### 3. SKILL.md Only (Fallback)
- Minimal installation
- Downloads only the SKILL.md file
- Works without any special tools
- Limited functionality for skills requiring additional files

## Usage

When you need to find and install a skill, simply tell Claude what you're looking for:

```
I need a skill for Python testing
```

```
Find me a skill to help with Docker
```

```
Search for skills related to API development
```

Claude will:
1. Search the skills database
2. Display matching results with ratings
3. Ask you to select one
4. **Download the complete skill folder** automatically
5. Show you the configuration and usage guide

## Installation

This skill includes the skills database file in the `data/` directory:
- `data/all_skills_with_cn.json` (30.33 MB)

## Technical Details

The skill uses Python to:
- Parse and search the JSON skills database
- **Automatically detect available download methods (SVN, Git, or HTTP)**
- **Use SVN export for efficient folder-only downloads**
- **Fall back to Git sparse checkout if SVN unavailable**
- Download complete skill folders with all files (scripts, data, docs)
- Install skills to `~/.claude/skills/` directory
- Parse skill configuration from SKILL.md content
- Display formatted installation guides with method used

## Download Method Selection

The skill intelligently selects the best method:

```python
if SVN available:
    → Use SVN export (fastest, most efficient)
elif Git available:
    → Use Git sparse checkout (slower but complete)
else:
    → Download SKILL.md only (minimal fallback)
```

**Why SVN for GitHub?**
- GitHub supports SVN protocol for folder-level access
- Much faster than cloning entire repositories
- No Git history overhead
- Perfect for downloading specific skill folders
